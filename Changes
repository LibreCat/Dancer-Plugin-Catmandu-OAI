    - "granularity" can be set to these two options in the plugin configuration:

        - YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
        - YYYY-MM-DD

    - "fix" can be set in the plugin configuration:

    - this "fix" fixes the input record(s). This is a global fix that is
      applied before any action is taken on the record.

      e.g. GetRecord, ListRecords, and ListIdentifiers share this fix

        - This is not the same as the fix, as configured for every metadataPrefix.
          First of all the global fix is applied, and later the fix for the metadataPrefix is applied.

    - "datestamp" is copied from the fixed record (see above), instead of fixed by "_combined_utc_datestamp"

        Fixing the datestamp values is up to the global fix (see: Catmandu::Fix::datetime_format).
        One should make sure that the values in this field honor the configured "granularity".

    - "default_search_params" can be set in the plugin configuration:

        These arguments are given to the search method of the Catmandu::Bag.
        Beware that these are overwritten inline by "start","limit", "query" and "cql_query",
        so those cannot be used.

    - $bag->get is changed by $bag->search in "GetRecord"

        To honor the "default_search_params", the search method of the Catmandu::Bag is used.
        These parameters are preset, and cannot be changed by "default_search_params".
